            The local decoder sample shows how you can install a video decoder for use by the
            application when playing video encoded in a format supported by the decoder. This
            feature can be used to provide support for video formats not nativelly supported
            by Windows 8. As with all Media Plugins, the plugin is only available to this application
            and only when the application is running.</p>
