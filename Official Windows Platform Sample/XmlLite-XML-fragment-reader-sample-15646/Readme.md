## Description

<div id="mainSection">
<p>This sample shows how to read large XML documents as fragments with XmlLite, using a method called chunking.
</p>
<p>When XML documents are very large, chunking allows you to read large documents while maintaining a predictable memory usage profile. Chunking is a technique where the module using XmlLite can choose to retrieve a maximum amount of data in a single method
 call, instead of getting the value for an element or an attribute all at once. If the element or attribute has more data than the specified maximum, chunking allows the data to be retrieved in multiple sequential calls to a method.</p>
<p>The XmlLite library allows developers to build high-performance XML-based applications that provide a high degree of interoperability with other applications that adhere to the XML 1.0 standard. The primary goals of XmlLite are ease of use, performance,
 and standards compliance. XmlLite works with any Windows language that can use dynamic link libraries (DLLs), but Microsoft recommends C&#43;&#43;. XmlLite comes with all necessary support files for use with C&#43;&#43;, but if you want to use it with other languages, some
 additional work may be required.</p>
