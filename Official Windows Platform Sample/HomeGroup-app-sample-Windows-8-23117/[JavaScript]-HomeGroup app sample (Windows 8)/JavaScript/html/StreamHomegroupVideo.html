            Video, audio, and image streaming has been built into the WinRT API's so that users don't have to wait for a large file to completely load before consuming the content. The Windows 8 "PlayTo" SDK sample has more information on streaming and managing media over networks. This scenario shows the simple case of picking a video on the homegroup, and streaming it to a video tag.
