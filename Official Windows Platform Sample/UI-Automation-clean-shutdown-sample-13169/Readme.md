## Description

<div id="mainSection">
<p>This sample has two pieces that work together to show the correct way to clean up and shut down a Microsoft UI Automation control that is hosted in a DLL. The first piece is a DLL that contains a simple control with a basic UI Automation provider. The second
 piece is an application that hosts the control. </p>
<p>When the host application starts, it displays the <b>Load DLL</b> button. When you press the button, the host application loads the DLL and uses it to create and display the control. Also, the text of the button changes to
<b>Unload DLL</b>. When you press the button again, the host application destroys the control and unloads the DLL.
</p>
<p>When the control is destroyed, the provider calls the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh437312">
<b>UiaDisconnectProvider</b></a> function. If any external UI Automation client applications were connected to the control, the call to
<b>UiaDisconnectProvider</b> ensures that the clients release their references so the DLL can unload safely.</p>
<p>A good way to see the sample work is to connect a UI Automation client application after you press the
<b>Load DLL</b> button. Two good client applications are Narrator (the screen reader application included with Windows) and Inspect (an accessibility testing tool included in the Windows Software Development Kit (SDK)).</p>

<h3>Build the sample</h3>
<p>To build this sample:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Visual Studio&nbsp;2013 and select <b>File</b> &gt; <b>Open</b> &gt; <b>Project/Solution</b>.
</li><li>Go to the directory in which you unzipped the sample. Go to the directory named for the sample. Go to the C&#43;&#43; directory and double-click the Visual Studio&nbsp;2013 Solution (.sln) file.
</li><li>In Solution Explorer, select UiaCleanShutdownControl to build the simple control DLL, or UiaCleanShutdownHost to build the host application. (You'll need to build both pieces to use this sample.)
</li><li>Press F7 (or F6 for Visual Studio&nbsp;2013) or use <b>Build</b> &gt; <b>Build Solution</b> to build the sample.
</li></ol>
<p></p>
<h3>Run the sample</h3>
<p>To run the sample after building it, follow these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Copy both pieces—the control DLL and the host application—to the same location. You'll find the control DLL at &lt;<i>install_root</i>&gt;\UI Automation Clean Shutdown Sample\C&#43;&#43;\UiaCleanShutdownControl\Debug\UiaCleanShutdownControl.dll, and the host application
 at &lt;<i>install_root</i>&gt;\UI Automation Clean Shutdown Sample\C&#43;&#43;\UiaCleanShutdownHost\Debug\UiaCleanShutdownHost.exe.
</li><li>Navigate to the location where you copied both pieces of the sample. </li><li>Type UiaCleanShutdownHost.exe at the command line, or double-click the icon for UiaCleanShutdownHost.exe to launch it from Windows Explorer.
</li></ol>
