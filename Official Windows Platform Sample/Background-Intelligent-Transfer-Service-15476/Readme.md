## Description

<div id="mainSection">
<p>This sample demonstrates how to use the new IBackgroundCopyFile5 interface's GetProperty method to obtain the last set of HTTP headers received for each file in a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) download job. The information in the HTTP header
 could be used, for example, to determine the file type or when it last changed on the server. Prior to Windows&nbsp;8.1 and Windows Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2, BITS did not provide a means by which the application could retrieve and inspect the HTTP response headers of a completed
 download. This sample illustrates how to use the BITS API to create a BITS job with multiple URLs to download, list the URLs in a job, and retrieve the HTTP response headers for each URL.

<p class="note"><b>Note</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The Windows Samples Gallery contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various new programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows&nbsp;8.1 and/or Windows Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2. These downloadable samples
 are provided as compressed ZIP files that contain a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for the sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata necessary to successfully compile and run the sample. For more information about the programming
 models, platforms, languages, and APIs demonstrated in this sample, please refer to the guidance, tutorials, and reference topics provided in the Windows&nbsp;8.1 documentation available in the Windows Developer Center. This sample is provided as-is in order to
 indicate or demonstrate the functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows&nbsp;8.1 and/or Windows Server&nbsp;2012&nbsp;R2. Please provide feedback on this sample!</p>
