00:00:05.242 --> 00:00:08.501
My name is Jason Weber, and my job is to make Internet Explorer fast.

00:00:09.296 --> 00:00:14.305
We care about windows users, and windows users spend over half their time inside the web browser.

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:17.199
We want those users to have a great experience 

00:00:17.368 --> 00:00:18.390
and that means performance.

00:00:18.921 --> 00:00:22.593
Regularly on any given day we will measure the performance of IE hundreds of times

00:00:22.853 --> 00:00:25.504
typically using thousands of different tests

00:00:25.642 --> 00:00:31.291
which results in anywhere from five to six million plus different metrics that we end up analysing.

00:00:31.484 --> 00:00:33.567
We think about it in three different ways

00:00:33.882 --> 00:00:38.576
the first is we wanna make the web sites that customers that use today extremely fast

00:00:38.712 --> 00:00:40.511
so your traditional browsing scenarios

00:00:40.616 --> 00:00:45.334
the second class is that we want to make the interactive AJAX applications 

00:00:45.465 --> 00:00:46.925
that the customers use every day

00:00:47.096 --> 00:00:48.958
extremely responsive

00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:52.892
and the third class is really the HTML5 applications of tomorrow

00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:55.391
and enabling the next generation of the web.

00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:58.207
In order to measure the performance of the browser

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.048
we sorta had to build our own version of the internet

00:01:01.191 --> 00:01:06.770
Both replicating different network topologies, different server configurations, 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.770
as well as different client configurations and measuring anything from memory usage to 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.770
CPU utilization, elapsed time, that end users see and really try to get a representative 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:21.770
sample of what customers will see in their real world experience replicated in this lab.

00:01:21.905 --> 00:01:24.468
Benchmarks can be a very good way to measure performance.

00:01:24.611 --> 00:01:28.201
However, if they are representative of what actual users are doing

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:32.663
and so if you have a small isolated benchmark it can be great for a subsystem

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.523
but it is not so great to represent what the real world users are doing.

00:01:37.657 --> 00:01:44.023
Performance is a multidimensional problem and Javascript is only one of the eleven subsystems in the browser

00:01:44.158 --> 00:01:45.780
that impacts performance

00:01:45.876 --> 00:01:50.384
With Internet Explorer 9 though we completely rearchitected our Javascript engine

00:01:50.521 --> 00:01:55.661
so that applications that make heavy use of Javascript are extremely fast.

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.269
So we're optimizing for a wide range of machines. From things like the netbook over here

00:02:00.404 --> 00:02:05.077
to high end desktops with eight cores, lots of memory

00:02:05.214 --> 00:02:09.131
and we really wanna have that be a great experience across that range.

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:14.829
Todays web browsers really haven't taken advantage of the full modern PC hardware

00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:18.918
and you're really limited to what developers can do inside their web applications.

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:23.783
With Internet Explorer 9 we're unlocking the full power of the PC

00:02:23.957 --> 00:02:29.647
and enabling web developers the potential that native application developers have had in the past two decades.

00:02:29.786 --> 00:02:34.861
Our approach for graphics in IE9 has been to accelerate everything.

00:02:34.977 --> 00:02:40.005
Text rendering, graphics rendering, colors on background images, I mean

00:02:40.146 --> 00:02:43.786
really everythig in IE9 you see on the screen

00:02:43.902 --> 00:02:46.123
is powered and displayed through the GPU

00:02:46.271 --> 00:02:51.978
As we move into the future with vector graphics technology, whether its canvas or SVG

00:02:52.083 --> 00:02:55.680
In IE9 those are all also hardware accellerated

00:02:55.772 --> 00:03:00.635
and as people deploy those on much better performance than you would have

00:03:00.765 --> 00:03:03.101
had we not use GPU

00:03:03.275 --> 00:03:08.784
With Internet Explorer 9, the web pages that you browse to every day just got a whole lot faster

00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:11.214
and the HTML5 applications of tomorrow

00:03:11.385 --> 00:03:12.128
are now possible.

00:03:12.527 --> 00:03:16.164
I think long term what GPU accelerated graphics

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.322
and coupled with the other performance improvements changes what can be approached

00:03:20.431 --> 00:03:25.018
and changes what you can do in a web site or web application

00:03:25.174 --> 00:03:28.341
things don't change overnight in the world anymore

00:03:28.476 --> 00:03:30.104
Not even on the web

00:03:30.214 --> 00:03:35.957
You look two years out and I think people will wonder what browsers was like without GPU acceleration.
