            Demonstrates how an app that integrates with the Cached File Updater contract can
            provide a new version of the file that is being accessed or keep using the current
            version as the file hasn't changed.
            <br />
            <br />
            Note: For apps that integrate with Cached File Updater contract, don't display UI
            unless necessary. For example, a version conflict exists or the user credentials
            are required.
