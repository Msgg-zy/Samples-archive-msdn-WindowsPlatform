                            The touch language defines the interactions you should use when building your app.
                            It's designed to provide touch-optimized interactions that are learnable and follow the
                            Windows design principles. Using these interactions makes your app more intuitive and
                            reliable for users. Each section includes instructions for key actions, and a demo area to
                            try them for yourself. The corresponding mouse and keyboard actions are also provided.
