            </div>
            <div class="scenarioDesc">
                Independent Animation, is the independent composition of CSS Animations/Transitions
                of non-layout properties. Non-layout properties are 2D Transform, Flat Mode 3D Transform
                and Opacity. These specific animations are targeted and composed separately from
                the UI thread. By composing on a separate thread these animations are not at risk
                of being blocked by the UI thread and glitching. There is no additional work or
                markup for the web developers to achieve Independent Animation. To see Independent Animation click
                the button below. The green circle is animated independently while the red circle
                is being composed on the UI thread. Move the slider to block the UI thread and observe
                the red circle glitching while the green circle continues to animate smoothly.
