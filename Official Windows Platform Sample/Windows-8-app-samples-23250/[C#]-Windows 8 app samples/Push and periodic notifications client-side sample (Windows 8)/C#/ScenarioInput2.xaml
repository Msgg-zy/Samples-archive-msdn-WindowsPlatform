      In this scenario, the app will renew its notification channel.
      <LineBreak/>
      <LineBreak/>
      Notification channels expire after 30 days. Every time your app is launched, it should renew your channel 
      and send it to your server to ensure your service always has an updated channel. Requesting a new channel 
      does not revoke previously acquired channels. If your app provides its primary content through its tile and 
      the user is not expected to launch the app frequently, it is recommended that your app consider using a 
      background task to periodically request a new channel in addition to requesting a new channel every time 
      your app is launched.
      <LineBreak/>
      <LineBreak/>
      Note that your app's package will need to set the "Internet (client)" capability in its manifest.
