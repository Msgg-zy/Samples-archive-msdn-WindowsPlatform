        <p>Some RDP resources can be launched in your app instead of in mstsc.exe. This is true when the .rdp file only contains RDP settings that are supported inside AppContainers.</p>
        <p>If you launch such a resource through the "Display and Launch" scenario, this page will display information about the RDP file and context below. You could then pass those RDP file contents to the IRemoteDesktopClient interface to make a connection.</p>
