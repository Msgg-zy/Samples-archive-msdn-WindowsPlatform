        <p>Whenever the user moves focus to an input field on a touch-enabled machine, the soft keyboard should
             appear automatically. The Windows Web App Host will ensure that the input field is scrolled into
             view. In most cases, you do not need to listen for keyboard events, or tamper with the host's
             standard keyboard behavior.</p>
        <p>All the same, your program may listen for the appearance and dismissal of the keyboard using the
             Windows.UI.ViewManagement.InputPane events. Should the host's default behavior with regard to the
             keyboard prove inadequate, you may suppress the host's reaction to the keyboard by setting
             the "ensuredFocusedElementInView" parameter of the InputPane event arguments. The animations wrapper contained
             in this sample should be used to animate part of your layout.</p>
