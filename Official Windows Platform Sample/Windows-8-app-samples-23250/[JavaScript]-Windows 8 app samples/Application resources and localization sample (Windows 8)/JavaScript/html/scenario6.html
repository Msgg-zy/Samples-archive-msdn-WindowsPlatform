            It is possible that, while an application is running, the language, scale, contrast
            or other settings may change. In order to handle these events, event listeners should
            be registered to listen for and react to the change.</p>
        <p>
            To see new resources, change the the language by going to the Desktop Control Panel &gt; Language &gt; Add a language that is supported by the app (de-DE, en-US, fr-FR, or ja)
                &gt; Move the new language to the top of the list.</p>
