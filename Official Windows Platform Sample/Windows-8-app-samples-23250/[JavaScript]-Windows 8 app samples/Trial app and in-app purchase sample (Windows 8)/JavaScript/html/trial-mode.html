        <p>
            This scenario illustrates how an app can determine what type of license the customer 
            has and then enable the products that correspond to that license.

            <!-- This is filler text. The displayed text is provided by updateCurrentLicenseMode() -->
            No license data.

            <button id="trialTime" title="Calculate remaining trial time">
                Trial period
            </button>
            Read the expiration date of the trial period, subtract today's date from the expiration date, 
            and then display the result, converted to days, in the output area. After the customer buys the app, 
            the expiration date is no longer meaningful.
        </p>
        <p style="display: none">
            You could use this to inform the customer that the trial period is ending soon and encourage them to buy the full version.

                Trial mode
            </button>
            Read the current license state to enable a product during the trial period and display the result in the output area.
        </p>
        <p style="display: none">
            This might be used for a product that is only available before the customer buys the app, such as displaying a banner to indicate they are running a trial version.

                Purchased
            </button>
            Read the current license state to enable a product that can only be used after the customer buys the app. 
            Display the result in the output area. Click <strong>Buy app</strong> to buy the app, and then try this button again.

                Buy app
