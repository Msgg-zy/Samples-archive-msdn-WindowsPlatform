            Sometimes you may want provide content in a different format or size for sharing.
            However, you may not want to do the work to prepare content for sharing until the target app actually requests it. In such cases, you should use delayed rendering.
        </p>
        <p>
            To demonstrate, please choose an image to be shared. When data is requested by the target app, the image will be resized by the source app. Since image manipulation may take
            some time, the image processing is deferred until it's requested by the target app.
        </p>
        <p>Data Package Title:</p>
        <input class="text-box" id="titleInputBox" value="My image" />
        <p>Data Package Description:</p>
        <input class="text-box" id="descriptionInputBox" value="Selected image from the Share Source sample" />
        <p>Select the image you would like to share</p>

                To share, bring up the charms bar and select Share (or press Win+H).<br /><br />
                You can also invoke the share window programmatically after prompting the user in response to an event
                (e.g. "You just beat the high score. Do you want to share this with your friends?")
