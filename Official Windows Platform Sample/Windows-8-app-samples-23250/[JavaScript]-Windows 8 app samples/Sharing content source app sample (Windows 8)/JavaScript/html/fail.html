            If the user tries to share when your app is not able to support share, you can provide a failure message that
            will be displayed in the share pane.  This message should help the user understand why they cannot share and
            what they need to do to complete their task.  You do not need to use this message if your app never supports share.
            Windows provides a default message for that case.

        <input class="text-box" id="displayTextInputBox" value="You have selected too many images.  Select less than 50 images and then try again." />

                To share, bring up the charms bar and select Share (or press Win+H).
