        <p>Snapping an app makes the app 320px wide,
        which allows it to share the screen with another app.
        It lets two apps be visible at the same time, so the user can multitask.
        Snapping is available on screens resolutions that are at least 1366px wide.</p>
        <p>This code sample illustrates how to:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Query for the current application view state</li>
            <li>Programmatically unsnap</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Press <strong>Win + .</strong> on your keyboard to cycle between the different application view states.</p>
