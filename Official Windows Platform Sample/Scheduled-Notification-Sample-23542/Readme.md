<p>This sample shows you how to use the Scheduled Action Service to schedule and manage reminders.
<span class="term">Reminders</span> are dialogs that pop up and display a message to the user at a time scheduled in the app that created them. For more info, see
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=219695">How to: Create Reminders for Windows Phone</a>.</p>
<p>You need to install the Windows&nbsp;Phone&nbsp;SDK to run this sample. To get started, go to the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=259204">Windows Phone Dev Center</a>.</p>
<p><span class="label">Silverlight for Windows Phone Toolkit</span> </p>
<p>This sample uses the date picker and time picker controls that are included in the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=202026">Silverlight for Windows Phone Toolkit</a>. The DLL from the toolkit, Microsoft.Phone.Controls.Toolkit.dll, is included with the sample, but may be blocked by Visual Studio because it has been downloaded
 as a file from the internet. You can either right-click the DLL file in Windows Explorer, select
<span class="ui">Properties</span>, and then click <span class="ui">Unblock</span>, or you can install the toolkit and reference the DLL from the installation.</p>
