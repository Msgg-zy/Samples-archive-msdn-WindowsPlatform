            Whenever your application is activated, the view running on the main thread is automatically shown. It may be desirable, though, for the most
            recently used view (including secondary views) to be shown instead. For example, a web browser may support several views, and should
            display the opened link in the window that is currently on screen. The app can state this preference by calling "DisableShowingMainViewOnActivation"
            before calling Window.Current.Activate on its first window.
        </p>
        <p>
            You can see how this option works by checking the box below, then restarting the app.
        </p>
        <input type="checkbox" id="disableMainBox"/>
        <label for="disableMainBox">Disable showing main view on activation (takes effect after suspend and restart)</label>
