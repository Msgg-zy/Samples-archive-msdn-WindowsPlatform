        <p>Demonstrates how to let users begin typing as a way to place focus on the Search box regardless of what currently has focus in the app. If your app is
           using the Search box, consider adding this feature to your app's main page and your app's search results page so that users can access the Search box 
           quickly while they are using a keyboard.</p>
        <p>Please follow these steps to try it out:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Ensure focus is not on the Search box</li>
            <li>Begin Typing a query</li>
        </ol>
