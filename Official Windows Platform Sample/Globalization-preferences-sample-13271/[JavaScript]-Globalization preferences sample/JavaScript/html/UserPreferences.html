        <p>This scenario will demonstrate how to determine the current user’s preferences region and language based settings, including: Language(s), Region, Calendar system, Clock, and First Day of the Week. These settings typically align with the defaults for a language and region combination, but the user could also customize in the Region control panel.  Note that the location returned may not reflect the current physical location of the user.</p>
