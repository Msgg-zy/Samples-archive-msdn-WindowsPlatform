## Description

<div id="mainSection">
<p>This sample shows device discovery and subscription modes for Universal Plug and Play (UPnP), along with querying variables, events, and invoking actions.
</p>
<p>This sample uses the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa381109">
UPnP Control Point API</a> provided by <b>upnp.dll</b>. The sample can discover devices on the network by using one of the three types of searches available:
<b>FindByType</b>, <b>FindByUDN</b> and <b>AsyncFind</b>. </p>
<p>The devices found by these search capabilities are instantiated in the device list. When a device is selected, service objects for the device are enumerated and listed in the service list. If the
<b>Delay Subscription</b> check box is selected when the desired device is selected, the
<b>Subscribe</b> button will become active and SCPD download and event subscription will be delayed when the services are enumerated. If the
<b>Delay Subscription</b> check box is not selected, the SCPD will be downloaded and the subscriptions will be done while enumerating services.
</p>
<p>One of the services can be selected and controlled by invoking actions against it. The events relevant to the service are displayed in the events field. If the
<b>Delay Subscription</b> check box was selected when the device was selected, click the
<b>Subscribe</b> button to start event subscriptions. If <b>Asynchronous Control</b> check box is selected, the asynchronous control methods will be used. If the
<b>Asynchronous Control</b> check box is not selected, the normal synchronous methods will be used.
</p>
