 rich responsive client applications. Hilo provides both source code and guidance that will help you design and develop compelling, touch-enabled Windows applications of your own. Follow us on Twitter @<a class="externalLink" href="http://twitter.com/projecthilo">projecthilo</a></span></p>

<h2>Hilo Annotator</h2>
<p>The Hilo Annotator uses the Windows Ribbon Control to provide easy access to the various annotation functions, and the Windows Imaging Component to load and manipulate the images and their metadata.<br>

The Hilo article series, along with the sample application source code, are intended to jumpstart your development and show you how to take advantage of key Windows capabilities in your own applications. The next articles in the Hilo series will describe how
 the Annotator is implemented using the Windows Ribbon control and the Windows Imaging Components. You can read all of the articles in the Hilo series
