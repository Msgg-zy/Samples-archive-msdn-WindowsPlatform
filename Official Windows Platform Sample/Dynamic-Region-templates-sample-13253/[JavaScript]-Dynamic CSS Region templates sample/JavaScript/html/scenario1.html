            This sample illustrates how a stream of HTML content can be flowed through a series
            of individual page templates, each of which is composed of one or more CSS regions.
            Each region will show a portion of the content stream, as described in other samples.
            Page templates will be created and removed depending on the size of the content
            stream and how much content fits into each individual page. To demonstrate this,
            please resize the program window or adjust the text size, and observe how new pages
            are created and removed as needed, so that there are never any empty pages and the
            complete content stream is always displayed. Furthermore, in snapped mode, pages
            are given a different layout so that text takes up the entire page, and the page
            navigation direction is changed from horizontal to vertical. The Javascript code
            in regionTemplatePage.js shows how developers can dynamically create and remove
            pages as needed, while the page templates in the "html" directory demonstrate how
            individual pages are designed, so that regions are laid out alongside other, static
            content specific to each page. In addition, this sample illustrates how to capture 
            keyboard events on both CSS Regions and non-Regions within a page, thereby allowing
            simple navigation between pages. For a more complete look at how to handle element 
            scrolling with gradual animations, please see the
            <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=254904">Input: Pan/scroll 
            and zoom sample</a>. In sum, the templates shown here, in combination
            with other HTML and CSS functionality, illustrate how a developer can create attractive
            content-driven apps, such as digital books, magazines, or newspapers, with the fluidity
            needed to paginate content across a wide variety of screen sizes, orientations,
            and resolutions.
