<div class="introduction">
<p>You should provide a settings page in your app if you want to enable a user to customize the appearance of your app, and save those customizations. You can optionally require the user to confirm settings changes by entering a name and password or by some
 other method. This sample shows how you can save and retrieve user settings for your app by adding a settings entry to the application bar. The app bar is the preferred location for launching the settings pages because it provides quick access to an appâ€™s
 most common tasks. In addition, in this sample, the settings values are saved as key/value pairs in isolated storage. Isolated storage is the ideal location to persist settings data.
</p>
<p>You need to install the Windows&nbsp;Phone&nbsp;SDK to run this sample. To get started, go to the
