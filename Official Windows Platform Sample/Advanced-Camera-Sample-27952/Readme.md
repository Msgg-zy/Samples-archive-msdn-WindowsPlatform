</div>
<p>This sample is an advanced example camera app that implements several features of the
<a href="file:///C:/devdocs/gallery_phone/w_media_capture/mediacapture.xml"><strong>MediaCapture</strong></a> API.</p>
<p>This sample implements the following features of a typical camera app.</p>
<ul>
<li>Initializing and cleaning up capture resources. </li><li>Capturing still images. </li><li>Variable photo sequence capture and individual frame settings. </li><li>Adjusting focus, flash, and exposure settings. </li></ul>
<p>This sample covers many of the same areas as the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=241428">
Media capture sample</a>, with a few important differences. This sample includes features, like variable photo sequence capture, which were introduced in Windows Phone 8.1 and are not currently available for Windows apps. Also, instead of being organized as
 a code sample, this app is designed using the best practices for building a high-quality camera app, including a heavy reliance on the ModelViewViewModel (MVVM) design pattern. If you are interested in building a fully functional camera app - as opposed to
 just adding minor camera capabilities to a more general app - it is recommended that you use this sample as the starting point for your app development.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="note">Variable photo sequence capture is not supported on all hardware devices, including all Windows&nbsp;Phone&nbsp;8 devices. This sample will show a warning message when switching to variable photo sequence mode on unsupported devices. Variable
 photo sequence capture is supported on the Windows Phone emulator.</p>
<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;This sample requires Windows&nbsp;8.1 and Microsoft Visual Studio&nbsp;2013 with Update 2 or later.</p>
