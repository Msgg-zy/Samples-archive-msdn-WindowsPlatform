        <p>This scenario shows how an app can support an in-app product that expires after a period of time.</p>
        <p>In-app products can have a limited lifetime, after which the customer will need to buy it again if he or she wants to use it.</p>
        <p>Read the product's expiration date from the Store API and show it here.</p>
