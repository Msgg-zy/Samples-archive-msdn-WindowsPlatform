<div class="introduction">
<p>This sample shows how to use the CultureInfo class to create a globalized app. The user selects a Locale. The app then displays information such as date, time, and currency in the correct format for the selected locale. This app has been localized to German
 and Spanish. This sample has been updated to show localization of the app bar and the app title that appears in the phone’s app list. For more information on globalizing and localizing your app,

<p>The solution in the top-level directory of this sample contains a Windows&nbsp;Phone project that demonstrates the globalized date, time, and currency formatting and a localized app bar. This solution can be opened, built, and deployed using the Windows&nbsp;Phone&nbsp;SDK.
 In the subfolder, AppRes, there is a solution that contains multiple native resource-only DLL projects that are used to localize the app title in the phone’s app list. To open or build this solution, you must have the full version of Visual Studio.</p>
