        <p>This sample demonstrates various gestures.
        Colored tiles as well as the background container may be dragged with touch, pen or mouse, and rotated or zoomed with touch. 
        With touch, more than one object can be independently manipulated at the same time.
        You cannot mix input modes in a single interaction, so the first contact type "wins", with this exception: pen cancels touch and "wins". <br />
        Tapping a tile changes the color; holding it restores it to its original size, position and color; tapping the background restores its size and position; holding on the background resets everything.
        In contrast to the advanced case, the underlying code demonstrates how to statically create gestures.
