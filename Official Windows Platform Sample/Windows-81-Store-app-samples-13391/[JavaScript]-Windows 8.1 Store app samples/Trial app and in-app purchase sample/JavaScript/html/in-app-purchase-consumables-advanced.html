        <p>
            This scenario shows two different consumable in-app products. Consumable products require both a purchase call and a fulfillment call per purchase. This scenario shows the calls happening separately for demonstration purposes only; DO NOT require a user action for fulfillment in your app.

            </button>
            Display the purchase dialog box to buy product 1. Do not immediately call the fulfillment method. Query the Store API to get the in-app offer information and show it here:
