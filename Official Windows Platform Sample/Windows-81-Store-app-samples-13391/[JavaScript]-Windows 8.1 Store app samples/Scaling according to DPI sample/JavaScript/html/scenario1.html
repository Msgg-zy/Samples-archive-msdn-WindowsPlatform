        <p>
            When a screen's pixel density (DPI) and resolution are very high, Windows scales
            images and other UI elements to maintain physical sizing across devices. We recommend
            that you make your app <b>scaling aware</b> by providing multiple versions of
            these assets so that they retain quality across different scale factors. If you
            don't provide multiple versions, Windows will stretch your assets by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Windows Store apps, the following table demonstrates different methods you can use to ensure
            that Windows loads the correct asset depending on scaling percentage. The table also show what
            would happen if you didn't provide multiple assets. We recommend that you choose the appropriate
            method depending on your app's specific scenarios so use the descriptions in the table to guide
            you as you make your decision. In some cases, you might want to use multiple methods. The table
            also shows you info about the device's current scale, which includes the minimum requirements a
            screen must meet to default to this scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b> Use the simulator to view this scenario at different scaling percentages.
            For the 100% scale, use the 10.6" 1366x768 resolution setting. For 140% use 10.6"
            1920x1080 and for 180% use 10.6" 2560x1440.

                    not scaling aware. This may be difficult to see in the simulator but notice how
                    the asset is distorted at the 140% and 180% scale factors. </span></td>

            <tr>
                <th>Scaled packaged assets</th>
                <td>The framework can automatically display the right asset from your package based
                    off the current DPI. To enable this behavior, your must include 
                    3 versions of each asset using the appropriate naming convention: image.scale-100.png,
                    image.scale-140.png and image.scale-180.png. Then, when you use "image.png" within
                    your app, Windows will automatically use the correct asset based on the current
                    scale factor.
                    <br /><br />When using the HTML framework, this method will select the correct image
                    when the app is launched. However, if the scale changes dynamically during runtime (for
                    example, if the app is moved to a different monitor), the asset will be dynamically 
                    reloaded in some usage cases but not others. In particular, when an image resource is
                    used with a CSS background-image style, it will be reloaded automatically by Windows. An
                    img element, however, is not automatically reloaded. To ensure that your app retains the
                    best display when used in multi-monitor configurations, a small amount of code is needed
                    to make resources in img elements reload. See scenario1.js for how this is done for the
                    image shown to the right.
                    <br /><br />Note: The image shown to the right has had text added to make clear which
                    version of the image is actually loaded.

                    to make the app scaling aware. Include a single .svg asset and it will retain it's
                    quality regardless of scale factor. </td>
