            HomeGroup is one of the known locations that can be suggested to the file picker as a starting location. The file picker will open at the last opened location and not always the suggested location. Go up to the top level or select HomeGroup in the file picker menu to browse the HomeGroup namespace.  HomeGroup will only be available if the PC belongs to a homegroup.
