            (b) "completed" is triggered when the user lifts his or her finger; <br />
            (c) "canceled" is triggered when the user either returns to the edge where the drag began or continues dragging into the middle of the screen.</p>
        <p>2. Mouse: Right-click anywhere in the sample. This will trigger the "completed" event.</p>
