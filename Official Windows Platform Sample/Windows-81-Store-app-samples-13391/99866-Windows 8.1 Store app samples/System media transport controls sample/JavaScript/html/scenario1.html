        <p>Select some audio or video files to play.  Then use media keys such as "Play/Pause", "Previous" or "Next" on the keyboard to control
           playback.  Observe the system flyout displayed on the screen's upper right.  Try bringing up the flyout with keyboard keys (or hardware 
           buttons on a tablet device) for volume up and volume down.  Use (with mouse or touch) the flyout's software buttons to control playback.
           Also try these features with the app playing in the background, or while you are on the lock screen.</p>

            HTML5 specifies that both audio and video content are supported by both <audio> and <video> elements.
            <audio> elements simply do not render the video stream, so for this sample we will use <video> to
            play video as well as audio-only content.

            HTML5 audio and video elements share more or less the same properties, methods and events, so the same 
            sample script code would work basically unmodified with an <audio> element below in place of <video>.
