            Demonstrates how an app that integrates with the Cached File Updater contract can
            receive a new version of the file that was changed by the calling app. In this example
            we assume a conflict exists and the Cached File Updater contract app can either
            overwrite their version of the file or fork by creating new file.
            <br />
            <br />
            Note: For apps that integrate with Cached File Updater contract, don't display UI
            unless necessary. For example, a version conflict exists or the user credentials
            are required.
