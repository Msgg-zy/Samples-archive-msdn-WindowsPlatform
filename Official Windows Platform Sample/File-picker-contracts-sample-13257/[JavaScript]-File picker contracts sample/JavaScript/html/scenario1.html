            Demonstrates how this app can use the File Open Picker contract to provide a location
            that users can pick files from. Launch the file picker with the "Pick file" button
            and select "File picker contracts JS sample" app from the list of locations.
        <br />
        <br />
            The sample opens a page similar to this one that demonstrates the code needed to
            pick a file from either a local storage location or a URI.
        <br />
        <br />
            If your app were selected from the list of locations instead of this sample, it
            should open a page of your app specifically designed to display the files and folders
            available from your app. Use the file open picker contract template available through
            Visual Studio to design the file picker page for your app.
