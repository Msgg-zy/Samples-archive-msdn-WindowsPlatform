<div class="introduction">
<p>The mock in-app purchase library is designed to simulate in-app purchase capabilities for your app without submitting the app to the Windows Phone Dev Center or setting up a mock service.</p>

<p>Windows Phone 8 introduces in-app purchase, a new way for you to earn more money with your apps. Through in-app purchase you can sell digital content in your app. Windows Phone 8 offers a consistent purchase experience on the phone, safe handling of personal
 information, all of which contribute to a confident purchase experience for the consumer.</p>
<p>The mock in-app purchase library is a wrapper around the In-App Purchase APIs. Based on how you initialize the library, it will either mock all the responses of the products you defined for testing, or pass through all calls to the live In-App Purchase API.
 You can target various test scenarios by using the real APIs or mock APIs based on changing a flag value.
</p>
<p>The library is designed to mimic the way in-app purchase works. In &quot;Mock Mode&quot;, the library maintains a list of your receipts in addition to state information for every license. This way you can exercise the entire browse, search, purchase, and fulfillment
 flow. In &quot;Mock Mode&quot;, the library doesnâ€™t activate the in-app mock purchase screen, but provides a simple message box during the in-app purchase flow when testing in the emulator.</p>
