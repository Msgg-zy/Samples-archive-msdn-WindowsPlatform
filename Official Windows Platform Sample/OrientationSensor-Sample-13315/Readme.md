## Description

<h3>OrientationSensor Sample</h3>
<p>Demonstrates use of the Windows.Devices.Sensors.OrientationSensor API. </p>
<p>This sample allows the user to view the rotation-matrix and Quaternion values that reflect the current device orientation. You can choose one of two scenarios:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Orientation sensor data events </li><li>Current orientation sensor reading </li></ul>
<p>Orientation Sensor Data Events </p>
<p>When you choose the Enable button for the Orientation sensor data events option, the app will begin streaming sensor readings in real time.</p>
<p>Current Orientation Sensor Reading </p>
<p>When you choose the Get button for the Current orientation sensor reading option, the app will retrieve the most recent sensor reading.</p>

<p>The Windows Developer Preview Samples Gallery contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various new programming models, platforms, features, and components available for the BUILD conference. These downloadable samples are provided as compressed
 ZIP files that contain a Visual Studio Express (BUILD release) solution (SLN) file for the sample, along with the code pages, assets, and metadata necessary to successfully compile and run the sample. For more information on the programming models, platforms,
 languages and APIs demonstrated in this sample, please refer to the guidance, tutorials and reference provided in the Windows Developer Preview documentation available in the BUILD-specific version of the Windows Developer Center. This sample is not the final
 shipping version of the sample, and is provided “as-is” in order to indicate or demonstrate the early functionality of the programming models and feature APIs for a forthcoming version of Windows. Please provide feedback on this sample!</p>
