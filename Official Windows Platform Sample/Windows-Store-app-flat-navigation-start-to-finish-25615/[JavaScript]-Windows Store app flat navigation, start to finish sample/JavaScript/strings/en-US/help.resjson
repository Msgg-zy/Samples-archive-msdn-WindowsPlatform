For example, if your app has proven easy to use, help content might not be necessary. If there are one or two UI elements in your app that are a bit tricky for users to understand, try integrating tips into the UI, creating a simple in-app demo, or redesigning those elements to avoid creating help that only addresses one or two simple fixes.
