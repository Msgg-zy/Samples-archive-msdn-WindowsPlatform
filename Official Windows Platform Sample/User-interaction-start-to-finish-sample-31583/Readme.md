## Description

<p>This instructional sample app for Windows 8.1 shows how to use the built-in interaction behaviors of platform controls for intuitive and engaging user experiences. Follow the guidelines, best practices, and examples described here to define these user experiences
 for your Windows Store app.</p>
<p>The platform controls can handle and respond to input from a variety of sources, including touch, touchpad, mouse, pen/stylus, and keyboard. They can also process input from a variety of input device modes, such as touch keyboard, mouse wheel, and pen eraser.</p>
<p>While other operating systems focus primarily on touch input, Windows enables you to build the kind of app you want, regardless of input device: consumption apps, productivity apps, innovative hybrid apps on PCs, laptops, tablets and pretty much any kind
 of form factor out there (and not quite there yet).</p>
<p>This is the companion sample for the User interaction, start to finish (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=397442">HTML</a> and
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=397443">XAML</a>) topic.</p>
<p><strong>DESCRIPTION</strong><strong></strong></p>
<p>Use the default Windows Store app experiences provided by the platform controls for handling input from various sources (including touch, touchpad, mouse, pen/stylus, and keyboard) and input-device modes (such as touch keyboard, mouse wheel, and pen eraser).
 The sample follows Windows 8.1 principles, recommendations, and implementation details for platform controls, UI accessibility, and interactions.</p>
<p>In the sample, we implement a simple color mixer. The color mixer is a square object that takes indirect form input, which is used to specify an RGB color and an angle of rotation. The rotation value is used to calculate the level (0 to 255) of the selected
 color.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> We recommend that you use the platform control libraries (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389074">HTML</a> and
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389073">XAML</a>) wherever possible. The controls in these libraries provide the full Windows 8.1 user interaction experience, including standard interactions, animated physics effects, visual feedback, and
 accessibility. If you don't need customized interaction support, use these built-in controls.</p>
<p>This app is based on the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=325593">
Flat navigation sample</a> and meets all basic Windows Store certification requirements and covers:</p>
<ul>
<li>Handling input from various input devices </li><li>Platform controls and built-in user interaction support </li><li>Form traversal </li><li>Embedded panning/scrolling behaviors </li><li>Touch keyboard behaviors </li></ul>
