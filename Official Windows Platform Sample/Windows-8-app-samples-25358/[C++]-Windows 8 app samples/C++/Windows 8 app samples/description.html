<h2>Windows 8 Code Samples</h2>
<p>This sample pack includes all the app code examples developed and updated for Windows 8. The sample pack provides a convenient way to download all the samples at once. The samples in this sample pack are available in C#, C&#43;&#43;, VB.NET, and JavaScript.The Windows
 Samples Gallery contains a variety of code samples that exercise the various new programming models, platforms, features, and components available in Windows 8 and/or Windows Server 2012. These downloadable samples are provided as compressed ZIP files that
 contain a Visual Studio solution (SLN) file for the sample, along with the source files, assets, resources, and metadata necessary to successfully compile and run the sample. For more information about the programming models, platforms, languages, and APIs
 demonstrated in this sample, please refer to the guidance, tutorials, and reference topics provided in the Windows 8 documentation available in the Windows Developer Center. This sample is provided as-is in order to indicate or demonstrate the functionality
 of the programming models and feature APIs for Windows 8 and/or Windows Server 2012.</p>
<p>This pack may be very large and take some time to download.</p>
