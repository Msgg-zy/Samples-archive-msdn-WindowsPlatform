            Clicking on the <b>Launch Default Handler</b> button will launch a .png file with the default handler installed on the system.<br />

            Clicking on the <b>Launch Open With</b> button will launch the 'Open With' dialog that lets the user chose the handler for the .png file.<br />
            Clicking on the <b>Pick and Launch</b> button will launch the file picker that lets the user pick the file to launch. The picked file is then launched.<br />
