            Demonstrates how to use the Cached File Updater contract to provide updates for
            files. When an app is integrated with the Cached File Updater contract it can provide
            or receive updates for specified files. These specified files are files that the
            user picks from your app through the file picker.
        <br />
        <br />
            To try it, launch the File picker sample app and select one of the cached file scenarios. 
            (You can view and download the File picker sample app from the Samples section on MSDN.)
