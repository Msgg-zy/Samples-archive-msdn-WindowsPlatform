        <p>
            When a screen's pixel density (DPI) and resolution are very high, Windows scales
            images and other UI elements to maintain physical sizing across devices. We recommend
            that you make your app <b>scaling aware</b> by providing multiple versions of
            these assets so that they retain quality across different scale factors. If you
            don't provide multiple versions, Windows will stretch your assets by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            For Windows Store apps, the following table demonstrates different methods you can use to ensure
            that Windows loads the correct asset depending on scaling percentage. The table also show what
            would happen if you didn't provide multiple assets. We recommend that you choose the appropriate
            method depending on your app's specific scenarios so use the descriptions in the table to guide
            you as you make your decision. In some cases, you might want to use multiple methods. The table
            also shows you info about the device's current scale, which includes the minimum requirements a
            screen must meet to default to this scale.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Note:</b>Use the simulator to view this scenario at different scaling percentages.
            For the 100% scale, use the 10.6" 1366x768 resolution setting. For 140% use 10.6"
            1920x1080 and for 180% use 10.6" 2560x1440.

                    not scaling aware. This may be difficult to see in the simulator but notice how
                    the asset is distorted at the 140% and 180% scale factors. </span></td>

                <th>Modern Resource Technology (MRT)</th>
                <td>For assets located within the app package, MRT can be used. To use MRT, include
                    3 versions of each asset using the appropriate naming convention: image.scale-100.png,
                    image.scale-140.png and image.scale-180.png. Then, when you use "image.png" within
                    your app, Windows will automatically use the correct asset based on the current
                    scale factor. Note that this method will not change the asset dynamically during
                    runtime. The correct image is selected when the app is launched. </td>

                <td>Instead of including multiple bitmap resources, vector graphics can also be used
                    to make the app scaling aware. Include a single .svg asset and it will retain it's
                    quality regardless of scale factor. </td>

            <tr>
                <th>Media Query</th>
                <td>CSS media queries can also be used to determine when to load different versions
                    of an asset. This method may be best for scenarios where an asset is located externally
                    on the web but may also be used for local content. CSS media queries use logical
                    DPI, which is easily translated to scale factor: 96 logical DPI for 100%, 134.4
                    logical DPI for 140% and 172.8 logical DPI for 180%. </td>
