## Description

<p><span style="font-size:small"><strong>An instructional sample app for Windows 8.1 Preview that implements common file-handling features. This is the companion sample for the
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=390720">File handling, start to finish</a> article.</strong></span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">This sample, and the accompanying <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=390720">
File handling, start to finish</a> documentation,<strong> </strong>illustrates how to add file handling capabilities to a JavaScript / HTML Windows Store app, from start to finish. The sample includes instructions and code to perform the following file-handling
 tasks:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:small"><strong>File and Folder Pickers</strong> &ndash; Pickers display a list of files or folders from which a user can select one or more items for further processing. This sample includes code and guidance for presenting file and
 folder pickers to a user where a single file can be selected, multiple files can be selected, and a single folder can be selected.
</span></li><li><span style="font-size:small"><strong>File Access Basics</strong> &ndash; Illustrates several key file-access features such as programmatically enumerating the files of a given folder, retrieving a file's properties (including top-level, basic, and extended
 properties), creating a file, and writing data to and reading data from a file. </span>
</li><li><span style="font-size:small"><strong>Smart Files</strong> &ndash; Microsoft OneDrive files can be marked as either available-offline (default) or online-only. This capability enables users to move large files (such as pictures and videos) to their OneDrive,
 mark them as online-only, and save disk space (as a file containing only metadata about the remote file is kept locally). This sample illustrates how to use the new
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=324487">StorageFile.IsAvailable</a> property to determine if a file is currently available.
</span></li></ul>
