## Description

<div id="mainSection">
<p>This sample demonstrates how to block a Background Intelligent Transfer Service (BITS) job from downloading over expensive connections such as a roaming cellular link. BITS provides a COM interface for asynchronous downloads and uploads over HTTP or Server
 Message Block (SMB) protocols. Progress is saved periodically so that transfers can resume after the computer is restarted. An application can control whether BITS transfers data when the network usage may be more expensive, such as when a cellular modem is
 roaming or the cellular account has exceeded its monthly data limit. This sample shows how to use the BITS API to create a BITS transfer and configure its network cost policy to prevent these costly scenarios.
