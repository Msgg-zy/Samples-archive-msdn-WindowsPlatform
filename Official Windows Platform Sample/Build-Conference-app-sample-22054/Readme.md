## Description

<div id="mainSection">
<p>This sample contains the code for the //BUILD 2011 Conference sample app that was distributed to show attendees. This sample shows a number of different features of Windows&nbsp;8 that you can use in your Windows Store app using JavaScript, as well as good UX
 and design practices. </p>
<p>Specifically, this sample is the full source of the BUILD App that is pre-installed on the Windows Developer Preview build. It provides a concrete implementation of a Windows Store app that follows good UX practices. It provides a useful example of how to
 solve some specific problems in building your own apps, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>how to structure views, </li><li>how to use the WinJS library </li><li>how to handle PLM lifecycle events </li><li>how to integrate with the Platform using contracts </li></ul>
<p>Since this app shipped was used by attendees at the BUILD event, it is significantly more complex than many of our other samples. It is not intended to be a starting point for your own app and should be used more as a guide than as a rule. It is known to
 have issues running under the Simulator and should be run on the Local Machine for debugging instead.
