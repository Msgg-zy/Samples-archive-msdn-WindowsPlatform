<p><span style="font-size:small">This instructional sample app for Windows 8.1 shows how to create custom user interactions that are intuitive and engaging, and at the same time efficient and consistent across all input devices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">While other operating systems focus primarily on touch input, Windows enables you to build the kind of app you want without constraints: consumption apps, productivity apps, or innovative hybrid apps on PCs, laptops, tablets
 and pretty much any form factor out there (and even some that aren&rsquo;t quite there yet).</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">This is the companion sample for the User interaction customization, start to finish (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=329868">HTML</a> and
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389067">XAML</a>) topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small"><strong><br>
</strong>Customize the user interaction experiences in your Windows Store app based on input from various sources (including touch, touchpad, mouse, pen/stylus, and keyboard) and input-device modes (such as touch keyboard, mouse wheel, and pen eraser). The
 sample follows Windows 8.1 principles, recommendations, and implementation details for custom controls, UI accessibility, and customized interactions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">In this sample, a simple shape object that supports rotation is used to implement a basic color mixer. Select any of the three additive, primary colors (red, green, or blue) along the top of the page. When a color has been selected,
 the shape can accept user input from a touch screen, touchpad, mouse, pen, or keyboard either directly or indirectly through supporting input UI. All input data is processed by the object as a rotation interaction with the angle of rotation used to calculate
 the level (0 to 255) of the selected color. Each of the red, green, and blue color components can be selected and mixed at will.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small"><strong>Note</strong> We recommend that you use the platform control libraries (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389074">HTML</a> and
<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389073">XAML</a>) wherever possible. The controls in these libraries provide the full Windows 8.1 user interaction experience, including standard interactions, animated physics effects, visual feedback, and
 accessibility. If you don't need customized interaction support, use these built-in controls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-size:small">This app is based on the <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=325593">
Flat navigation sample</a> and meets all basic Windows Store certification requirements and covers:</span></p>
<ul>
<li><span style="font-size:small">Custom controls</span> </li><li><span style="font-size:small">Handling input from various input devices </span>
</li><li><span style="font-size:small">Designing interactions based on Windows user interaction guidelines</span>
</li><li><span style="font-size:small">Processing pointer and gesture input</span> </li></ul>
