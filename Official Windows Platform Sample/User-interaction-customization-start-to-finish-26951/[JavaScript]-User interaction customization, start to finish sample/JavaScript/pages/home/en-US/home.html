            <p>While other operating systems focus primarily on touch input, Windows enables you to build the kind of app you want without constraints: consumption apps, productivity apps, or innovative hybrid apps on PCs, laptops, tablets and pretty much any form factor out there (and even some that aren’t quite there yet).</p>
            <p>This is the companion sample for the User interaction customization, start to finish (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=329868">HTML</a> and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389067">XAML</a>) topic.</p>
            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p>Customize the user interaction experiences in your Windows Store app based on input from various sources (including touch, touchpad, mouse, pen/stylus, and keyboard) and input-device modes (such as touch keyboard, mouse wheel, and pen eraser). The sample follows Windows 8.1 principles, recommendations, and implementation details for custom controls, UI accessibility, and customized interactions.</p>
            <p>In this sample, a simple shape object that supports rotation is used to implement a basic color mixer. Select any of the three additive, primary colors (red, green, or blue) along the top of the page. When a color has been selected, the shape can accept user input from a touch screen, touchpad, mouse, pen, or keyboard either directly or indirectly through supporting input UI. All input data is processed by the object as a rotation interaction with the angle of rotation used to calculate the level (0 to 255) of the selected color. Each of the red, green, and blue color components can be selected and mixed at will.</p>
            <p><strong>Note</strong> We recommend that you use the platform control libraries (<a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389074">HTML</a> and <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?LinkID=389073">XAML</a>) wherever possible. The controls in these libraries provide the full Windows 8.1 user interaction experience, including standard interactions, animated physics effects, visual feedback, and accessibility. If you don't need customized interaction support, use these built-in controls. </p>
            <p>This app is based on the Flat navigation sample and meets all basic Windows Store certification requirements and covers: </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Custom controls</li>
                <li>Handling input from various input devices </li>
                <li>Designing interactions based on Windows user interaction guidelines</li>
                <li>Processing pointer and gesture input</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <!-- Don't use a button when the action is to go to another page;
                    use direct links within the content or the nav bar to move between pages.
